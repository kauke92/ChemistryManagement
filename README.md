## Problem statement ##
The farmers are searching for a way to automate the process of recording when, what and the quantity of drugs administered to the animals. Currently, the way they execute this process is by buying the drug from the veterinary, recording how much was bought, administering the drug, recording the amount used and when it was administered and then calculating in their head or on paper the withholding period. This is potentially a major issue, as there are a lot of paper records that are at risk of becoming lost or damaged. This is why our client came up with the idea.

> "Our idea is to make this process easier for farmers by implementing an app that would record the details about the   drug bought, the animal it is administered to, when it was administered, the amount used and the amount of days the        animal is going to be treated. The app will then calculate the withholding period and store that information so that  the farmers will be able to generate a report with all the information captured."
